# 2 Weeks Out
## Encourage UCF players to sign up 
@everyone in the Discord, and include the same details from your earlier announcement 

## Confirm volunteer roster and extras
Reach out to each volunteer individually and confirm that they can attend. Thank them for their willingness to help, and tell them that you will forward additional tournament details next week. 

## Train volunteers (if needed)
Reach out to volunteers individually and find out if they have worked as a moderator and/or scorekeeper for a standard collegiate tournament before.

If this is someone’s first time volunteering, have them attend practice with the club if possible. This is the best way for them to learn the rules of gameplay without having to set aside dedicated time for volunteer training.  

Regardless of their experience levels, send them a condensed version of the rules that apply to your tournament. You can use these documents of mine as a basis, but check the updated rules for your tournament! Do not solely rely on these, as they will be out of date in the future.

* [NAQT Rules in Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MtqBL8BOsO_IYPtJIRqRp0fg8tMm7s-Xaegq1aCFGk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Confirm the room reservation with UCF
At this point, the registrar’s office should have already contacted you with the details of your officially booked room reservation. Email them back to...

* ...double-check that the room has not been double-booked. 
* ...get a number that you can call in case the doors are locked the morning of.

Additionally, write down the room reservation number on your reference page. This can be found in the confirmation email that the registrar’s office sent you. 

## Inspect all the rooms you will be using and take notes
Regardless of how familiar you are with the facilities you’re using, you need to visit the rooms you’ll be using for gameplay and make sure they have everything you need. 

Bring a buzzer set with you and check for the following:

* Can the seating in this room accommodate two teams of players? 
* Is there a moveable table or desk for the moderator to sit at?  
* Does each gameplay room have a power outlet near that table? Set up a buzzer set to check if needed
* Are there any tripping hazards or anything else in this room that could get in the way of gameplay? 
* If necessary, update your packing list with extension cords, chairs, or anything else that’s needed. 

I recommend using Room 146 as your control room.  

## Call parking services to confirm parking options
As of February 2023, Saturday visitors can park for free on the first floor of Garage C, but **do not take my word for it**. Contact [UCF Parking Services](https://parking.ucf.edu) and double-check with them. The last thing visiting teams need is a $40 fine at the end of the day.
