<h2 id="toc_0">categories: jekyll update</h2>

<h1 id="toc_1">Master Checklist</h1>

<h2 id="toc_2">Decide on a date for the tournament</h2>

<ul>
<li>Check to make sure it’s not the same date as a UCF home game, as you can’t reserve classrooms on those days: https://ucfknights.com/sports/football/schedule.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_3">For ACF:</h3>

<p>They will announce a specific date. </p>

<h3 id="toc_4">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>They will usually restrict tournament dates to a single weekend, so just choose that Saturday, with Sunday as a backup. </p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Submit a bid (ACF or NAQT)</h2>

<h3 id="toc_6">For ACF:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Look on the quiz bowl forums for that tournament’s global announcement—here’s <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26240">ACF Winter 2022</a> </li>
<li>for an example.</li>
<li>Find the link to the “bidding form.”</li>
<li>Provide any information they ask for and submit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_7">For NAQT:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Go to the NAQT site (https://www.naqt.com/), find the appropriate tournament, and fill out the host form. </li>
<li>An NAQT representative will contact you via email shortly. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_8">As soon as your bid is approved...</h1>

<h2 id="toc_9">Make a room reservation with UCF</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Classroom Reservation form can be accessed at the bottom of <a href="https://registrar.ucf.edu/classroom-reservations/">this page</a>. </li>
<li>Input the following: 

<ul>
<li>Select “Registered Student Organization or SGA/SGA Affiliated Agency”</li>
<li>Faculty Advisor: <Contact information can be found in the Club Wiki> </li>
<li>Event Name: <Name of tournament here> </li>
<li>Event Type: “Collegiate quiz bowl tournament” </li>
<li>Attendees: <the number of people you’re expecting, plus 10> </li>
<li>Event Description: “The Florida site of the (National Academic Quiz Tournaments)/(Academic Competition Federation) <year> <tournament name> tournament—we&#39;ll be hosting teams from other universities as well.”</li>
<li>Room Information: “Ideally, we could reserve ten rooms around the Lupfer Atrium side of Business Administration I.” </li>
<li>Requires multimedia: No</li>
<li>Setup: 7:30am</li>
<li>Start: 8:00am</li>
<li>End: 6:20pm</li>
<li>Cleanup: 6:20pm </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once you send this form, you should automatically receive a confirmation email.</li>
<li>In case you’re wondering, this location, the Lupfer Atrium, is ideal for several reasons: 

<ul>
<li>It has restrooms nearby</li>
<li>First floor and second floor rooms are all close to each other</li>
<li>It’s near the Student Union and parking Garage C</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The registrar’s office can take several business days to reply, so be patient. If you’re emailing them prior to the second week of the semester, don’t expect a reply until Monday of week three at the earliest. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_10">Start recruiting volunteers now, not later</h2>

<p>Your tournament cannot happen without at least one volunteer per room, and ideally two per room.  </p>

<p>Unless you’re willing to spend your own money to compensate volunteers with free lunch, you’ll need to rely on the generosity of the players in your local quiz bowl scene.
* Start with your club. Ask if anyone is ineligible for the competition due to their skill level and start writing down names. 
* Consider asking nearby schools, such as Valencia. You can offer to help them by volunteering for their future tournaments. 
O
nce you’ve recruited at least one volunteer per room, try to recruit two players who would be willing to step down and volunteer the morning of the tournament if need be. Hopefully, they won’t need to staff, but it beats finding out the morning of the competition that you don’t have enough volunteers to run the event.  </p>

<h3 id="toc_11">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>If you’re using NAQT questions, it’s safest to assume that no quiz bowl players or staff from nearby two-year or high schools will be eligible to volunteer. For more information, see <a href="https://www.naqt.com/schedule/assigned-packet-sets.jsp">this page</a>. </p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Post tournament details on the quiz bowl forums</h2>

<p>To make sure everyone knows about your tournament, it is customary to make a formal announcement on the quiz bowl forums. To make an announcement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/">quiz bowl forums</a> and make an account.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the “COLLEGIATE AND OPEN QUIZBOWL DISCUSSION” section.</li>
<li>Click the “Collegiate Announcements &amp; Results” link.</li>
<li>Click “New Topic” in the upper left.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t panic if you make a mistake or forget something—you can edit your post after you’ve submitted it. </p>

<p>Your post will have to be approved by a moderator, so don’t worry if it doesn’t show up immediately. </p>

<h3 id="toc_13">For ACF:</h3>

<ul>
<li>ACF will send you a template post, so all you need to do is just add the information specific to your site. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_14">For NAQT:</h3>

<ul>
<li>There’s no official NAQT announcement template, but you can use <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=392930&amp;">this earlier announcement</a> as a template.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_15">Announce tournament to UCF members</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a tentative signup sheet: 

<ul>
<li>Click “Make a copy” on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cf7gV7h66Y8eXI0iRCXeFQE-tVw-BbM0GlIBy20bGvI/edit?usp=sharing">this Google sheet</a>. </li>
<li>Add a new title.</li>
<li>Set it to be publicly editable. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a new event to the Discord server with the tournament details and the tentative signup link you just made.</li>
<li>@everyone in the Announcements channel with a message including:

<ul>
<li>The name of the tournament </li>
<li>The date and start time</li>
<li>The difficulty of the tournament</li>
<li>The approximate registration cost</li>
<li>Any eligibility requirements</li>
<li>A link to the tentative signup sheet you just made</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_16">Create a reference page for the day of the tournament</h2>

<p>When you’re planning and running a tournament, things move quickly, and there’s a lot of information you need to keep at your fingertips. I would recommend keeping a document for every piece of information that you may need the day of the tournament. </p>

<p>I would recommend Notes (Mac), Notion, Google Docs, or whatever platform you can access quickly and reliably. </p>

<p>For now, I would recommend including: 
* The room reservation number
* The phone number to call in case doors are locked
* Links to the forum post
* Link to the official tournament entry 
* Link to the official team rosters
* Any other relevant links or information as you find them</p>

<h1 id="toc_17">1 Month Out</h1>

<h2 id="toc_18">Start a running roster of all teams</h2>

<h3 id="toc_19">For ACF:</h3>

<p>The tournament coordinator will have reached out to you by now with more information, which will include a running sheet of teams who have signed up.</p>

<p>Just keep an eye on this sheet for now, and text nearby schools to get an idea of how many teams they’ll be sending.</p>

<p>In the meantime, start a Google Sheet with the names of each team and the names of each player. This will come in handy later. </p>

<h3 id="toc_20">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>On the NAQT site page for your tournament site, click on “Current Field” to see what teams have signed up. </p>

<p>Just keep an eye on this page for now, and text nearby schools to get an idea of how many teams they’ll be sending. </p>

<p>In the meantime, start a Google Sheet with the names of each team and the names of each player. This will come in handy later. </p>

<h1 id="toc_21">2 Weeks Out</h1>

<h2 id="toc_22">Encourage UCF players to sign up</h2>

<p>@everyone in the Discord, and include the same details from your earlier announcement </p>

<h2 id="toc_23">Confirm volunteer roster and extras</h2>

<p>Reach out to each volunteer individually and confirm that they can attend. Thank them for their willingness to help, and tell them that you will forward additional tournament details next week. </p>

<h2 id="toc_24">Train volunteers (if needed)</h2>

<p>Reach out to volunteers individually and find out if they have worked as a moderator and/or scorekeeper for a standard collegiate tournament before.</p>

<p>If this is someone’s first time volunteering, have them attend practice with the club if possible. This is the best way for them to learn the rules of gameplay without having to set aside dedicated time for volunteer training.  </p>

<p>Regardless of their experience levels, send them a condensed version of the rules that apply to your tournament. You can use these documents of mine as a basis, but check the updated rules for your tournament! Do not solely rely on these, as they will be out of date in the future. </p>

<p>At this point, the registrar’s office should have already contacted you with the details of your officially booked room reservation. Email them back to...</p>

<ul>
<li>...double-check that the room has not been double-booked. </li>
<li>...get a number that you can call in case the doors are locked the morning of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, write down the room reservation number on your reference page. This can be found in the confirmation email that the registrar’s office sent you. </p>

<h2 id="toc_26">Inspect all the rooms you will be using and take notes</h2>

<p>Regardless of how familiar you are with the facilities you’re using, you need to visit the rooms you’ll be using for gameplay and make sure they have everything you need. </p>

<p>Bring a buzzer set with you and check for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the seating in this room accommodate two teams of players? </li>
<li>Is there a moveable table or desk for the moderator to sit at?<br></li>
<li>Does each gameplay room have a power outlet near that table? Set up a buzzer set to check if needed</li>
<li>Are there any tripping hazards or anything else in this room that could get in the way of gameplay? </li>
<li>If necessary, update your packing list with extension cords, chairs, or anything else that’s needed. </li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend using Room 146 as your control room.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_27">Call parking services to confirm parking options</h2>

<p>As of February 2023, Saturday visitors can park for free on the first floor of Garage C, but <strong>do not take my word for it</strong>. Contact <a href="https://parking.ucf.edu">UCF Parking Services</a> and double-check with them. The last thing visiting teams need is a $40 fine at the end of the day. </p>

<h1 id="toc_28">1 Week Out</h1>

<h2 id="toc_29">Prepare notes for the opening meeting</h2>

<p>It is essential to establish expectations at the beginning of every tournament, regardless of how well everyone in the Florida quiz bowl circuit knows each other. This is especially true if there are any first-time competitors present.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend including the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>A brief welcome to the teams</li>
<li>An informal school roll call—confirm that each team has all members accounted for </li>
<li>Awards that will be given out (top ten individual players, etc.) </li>
<li>Lunch information (after what round) </li>
<li>Restroom locations </li>
<li>General expectations and rules: 

<ul>
<li>Time limits for answering tossups/bonuses</li>
<li>Devices need to be silenced and put away </li>
<li>Please watch your volume if you’re waiting for a round to finish</li>
<li>We’re breaking for lunch after round X </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Asking if anyone has any questions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_30">Send logistics/rules info to all teams</h2>

<p>I would recommend using email. You can this as a template: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvpymlu8sga7Q6EIlyWUQ5HV9jMO6FphdgXqYYciDLQ/edit?usp=sharing">Logistics Email Template for Teams</a>. </p>

<p>Be sure to include the map of BA1 in this document as an attachment to the email. </p>

<p>Send this email using the same address that you listed for the tournament entry and for the forum post! Otherwise it might go to people’s spam folders. </p>

<h2 id="toc_31">Send logistics/rules info to all volunteers</h2>

<p>Again, I would recommend sending all this information via email. </p>

<p>You can use this as a template: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9U5jKk7Ca8ORGsVMTgnvdvjHCDlphXpn7_yuP0ABXg/edit?usp=sharing">Logistics Email Template for Volunteers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_32">Reach out to teams for a last call for signups</h2>

<p>In a small quiz bowl circuit like ours, schools will allow teams to register up until the last minute—say, Thursday night for a Saturday tournament. However, it’s best to find out the final team count as soon as possible, since you need to ensure you have enough rooms and volunteers. </p>

<p>Either message the FL quiz bowl group chat or reach out via email to each school confirm how many teams each school is sending. </p>

<h2 id="toc_33">Send invoices to all registered teams</h2>

<p>Use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LAe9VNWhElItCBOFuhfGaHLt-TxHW9Zb/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=100109936307561193680&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">invoice template</a> and create a separate invoice for each school that’s attending. </p>

<p>Email it to the representative of each school. You can include this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NX8nZsaWjCiqzjThS6bjM5EeJaKRCV__82wzslSuD7I/edit">invoice message text</a> in your email. </p>

<h3 id="toc_34">For ACF:</h3>

<p>The ACF site director will give you access to a spreadsheet with each team’s registration details. </p>

<h3 id="toc_35">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>On the NAQT site page for your tournament site, click on “Current Field” to see each team’s registration details.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_36">Build the schedule after team count is confirmed</h2>

<p>I would strongly recommend using the HDWhite <a href="https://hdwhite.org/qb/schedules/">Quizbowl Schedule Generator</a>. 
Note that this site produces two links: </p>

<ul>
<li>An editable link—do not share this with anyone else!</li>
<li>A public link—this can be shared with volunteers and players</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_37">Set up your digital scoresheets</h2>

<p>In my experience, digital score sheets are the most straightforward, reliable solution. They can’t be lost, misplaced, or ruined by a spilled drink, and most importantly, they can be seen remotely—you don’t have to be in a room to see how far along the round has progressed. </p>

<p>I would <strong>strongly</strong> recommend using the scoresheet template from NAQT, regardless of whether or not you’re hosting a NAQT tournament. These score sheets calculate bonus and running totals automatically, so all the scorekeeper needs to do is add team names, player names, and a mark each time a question is answered. </p>

<h3 id="toc_38">Full instructions:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Open this blank <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wrjU6Fg-PKuR2B1MLvp_gAOluJyQvFy_EVPZMsd4Mq4/edit#gid=1305109048">NAQT Scoresheet</a>.</li>
<li>Click on the File tab, then “Make a Copy”</li>
<li>Select the folder you want to save this copy to. I’d suggest making a new folder with the tournament name, if you haven’t already. </li>
<li>Click “Make a Copy.” </li>
<li>Next, navigate to this new folder. Create a new sub-folder for each gameplay room. For example, if your tournament has five rounds of gameplay going on simultaneously, create five new folders. </li>
<li>Rename each folder with the room number and the last name of the reader who will be staffing it. This will save you a lot of headache later! See below. </li>
<li><strong>ADD IMAGE HERE</strong></li>
<li>Open the score sheet. </li>
<li>Fill out the red-highlighted cell next to the word “Event.” (For example, “NAQT SCT 2023 @UCF”) </li>
<li>Right-click the tab titled “Scoresheet” at the bottom, and click “Duplicate.” </li>
<li>Do this for as many rounds of gameplay as you have on the schedule, plus two more in case of tiebreakers or final matches. For example, if you’re playing a nine-game round robin, you should have a total of eleven tabs in this score sheet. </li>
<li>Rename each tab “Round 1,” “Round 2,” etc. with the last two called “Final Round #1” and “Final Round #2” </li>
<li>On each tab, fill in the red-highlighted cell next to the word “Round.” Make sure that this number is the same as the title of the tab! </li>
<li>You can leave the “Instructions” tab there for the score keeper’s reference. </li>
<li>Now go back to the Google Drive folder, right click this file, and click “Make a Copy.” Do this until you have one copy in each room folder. </li>
<li>Click on the person icon in the Google Drive menu and add the volunteer’s emails. It will automatically notify them via email that they’ve been granted access. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_39">Update your reference page for the day of the tournament</h2>

<p>You should be able to open this document on your laptop and reference it at any time. It should include every link or piece of information you could possibly need. </p>

<p>Here’s a non-exhaustive list:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The room reservation number</li>
<li>The phone number to call in case doors are locked</li>
<li>Links to the forum post</li>
<li>Link to the official tournament entry </li>
<li>Link to the official team rosters</li>
<li>Contact info for all teams</li>
<li>Contact info for all volunteers</li>
<li>An organized list of which teams are D1 and which are D2, if applicable<br></li>
<li>Editable link to tournament schedule</li>
<li>Shareable link to tournament schedule </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_40">Train your stats keeper</h2>

<p>In addition to the score keeping that happens during each round, someone has to take all this data and compile it in YellowFruit. This program takes round data and exports HTML score reports that can be uploaded to the tournament database. </p>

<p>In all likelihood, you as Tournament Director will be the scorekeeper. Be sure to bring a mouse, charger, or anything you need to work quickly. </p>

<p>Make sure you install YellowFruit before the tournament and check that the program can run on your device without crashing or stalling. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> YellowFruit is not available for Macs at this time. If you don’t own a PC, you will need to borrow a PC from a club member to use the day of the tournament. Don’t try to borrow a laptop from the library—you can’t download and run new programs on those. </p>

<h2 id="toc_41">Read the rest of this guide!</h2>

<p>While you have time, read ahead in this guide and make sure you understand what you need to do during the tournament. <strong>If you fail to plan for something and don’t realize until the day of the tournament, you will not have time to recover!</strong></p>

<h1 id="toc_42">1 Day Out</h1>

<h2 id="toc_43">Set up a group chat for all volunteers with relevant links</h2>

<p>If you have more than ten volunteers, you’ll need to create a separate Discord server and have them join that. </p>

<p>Either way, send them: </p>

<ul>
<li>A brief welcome message</li>
<li>The link to the Google Drive score sheets</li>
<li>The link to the tournament schedule </li>
<li>The link to the rules summary (for quick reference) </li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, ping each user to make sure they can actually see your messages.</p>

<h2 id="toc_44">Give volunteers access to score sheets</h2>

<p>If you followed the steps from earlier, you’ll have already added their emails to the Google Drive folder with the score sheets. </p>

<p><strong>Regardless, confirm with each volunteer that they can access their folder!</strong> You will not have time tomorrow morning for troubleshooting Google Drive permissions. </p>

<h1 id="toc_45">Give volunteers access to questions or print off questions</h1>

<p><strong>Note: Before you give anyone access to the questions, get confirmation in writing that they are volunteering and not competing.</strong>  For the sake of preserving question integrity, someone is ineligible to compete in a tournament the moment they have access to the questions. This even includes situations where someone’s email was added to the question folder but they didn’t actually access the questions yet. For everyone’s sake, double-check this! </p>

<h3 id="toc_46">For NAQT</h3>

<p>A representative should have already sent you a ZIP file containing questions. Upload these packets to a new Google Drive folder. Add your volunteers’ email addresses to the Share section of this folder. </p>

<h3 id="toc_47">For ACF</h3>

<p>A representative will have already sent you a Google Drive link. Just share this link with the volunteers. If they can’t access the link for some reason, just download the files, place them in a new Google Drive folder, and add their email addresses to that folder. </p>

<h1 id="toc_48">Write a packing list for tomorrow</h1>

<p>Before you go to sleep, make sure you know exactly what you need to bring with you the next morning. My packing list usually includes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Energy drink</li>
<li>Book prizes</li>
<li>Trophies (if applicable, i.e. ACF) </li>
<li>Paper plates and napkins (if you’re supplying lunch to volunteers) </li>
<li>Tape + tournament signs </li>
<li>USB mouse (for figuring out stats) </li>
<li>Library cart (it beats making four trips to your car and back) </li>
<li>Extension cords (along with a note of which specific rooms need them)</li>
<li>Any other extension cords you have</li>
<li>Laptop + charging cable</li>
<li>iPhone charger</li>
<li>3x UCF buzzer sets</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_49">Check your email inboxes for any stray emails</h2>

<p>Before you lay your head on your pillow the night before the tournament, check your email and your spam folder for any late registrations, last-minute questions, or other concerns. </p>

<h2 id="toc_50">Set several alarms</h2>

<p>As a tournament director, missing an alarm the morning of the tournament is a nightmare-level disaster, so set several alarms! Personally, I...</p>

<ul>
<li>Set an alarm on a manual alarm clock across from my bed </li>
<li>Set multiple alarms on my iPhone, using an unusual ringtone so I’m unlikely to sleep through them (like a Death Grips song or something) </li>
<li>Tell my friend (who works overnight shifts in a hospital) to give me a call if I haven’t texted him by 6:30am telling him that I’m awake. </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not saying you need to do all this, but you do need to make sure that there’s no possible way you miss your alarms. </p>

<h1 id="toc_51">Tournament Day</h1>

<h2 id="toc_52">Arrive two hours early</h2>

<p>You need to be done setting up by the time volunteers are arriving, so it’s better to have time to kill than to be running late. </p>

<p>Additionally, this gives you time to recover if any doors are locked and you need to get a janitor over there. </p>

<h2 id="toc_53">Check all doors and rooms are opened</h2>

<p>Some classrooms in BA1 have two doors, so make sure that each door is unlocked. </p>

<h2 id="toc_54">Set up power cords and buzzers</h2>

<p>Because you inspected the rooms a week ago, you’ll already have an idea of what rooms need extra power cords or other equipment. 
Make a note of which rooms are not using UCF buzzers—this makes packing up easier when teams are trying to leave. </p>

<h2 id="toc_55">Put navigation and volume warning signs up around BA1</h2>

<p>While it’s technically not allowed, I prefer to place volume warning signs around BA1. I&#39;d rather have to take down a sign than get noise complaints from players.</p>

<h2 id="toc_56">Set up opening meeting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Turn on all the lights</li>
<li>Turn on the projector</li>
<li>Pull up the publicly viewable tournament schedule</li>
<li>Play some light music to set the mood </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_57">Welcome teams as they arrive</h2>

<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

<h2 id="toc_58">Host opening meeting</h2>

<p>Just follow the notes you prepared earlier. </p>

<h2 id="toc_59">Compile statistics for each round</h2>

<p>As each round ends, immediately input the round data into YellowFruit. </p>

<p>When the last round before lunch is complete, upload your stats so far to the tournament database so players can view them during their lunch break. </p>

<h2 id="toc_60">Break for lunch</h2>

<p>I would strongly recommend allotting 45 minutes for lunch. If people take longer than this, you still have 15 minutes of wiggle room. Any longer than an hour, and you’re just burning daylight! </p>

<h2 id="toc_61">Rebracket or set up finals rounds as necessary</h2>

<p>You could write an entire manual just on this step, but for final rounds, just follow the instructions at the bottom of the HDWhite schedule. If you&#39;re hosting an NAQT tournament, they will tell you how to run final rounds. </p>

<h2 id="toc_62">Prepare notes for the awards ceremony</h2>

<ul>
<li>As the last round is coming to a close, you should have a solid idea of which teams are going to come out on top. </li>
<li>Prepare a list of the top highest-scoring individuals. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_63">Awards ceremony</h2>

<p>Quiz bowl crowds hate pomp and circumstance, so keep the announcements quick and straightforward.</p>

<p>Announce the winners from first place downwards, so they can get first picks of the book prizes. </p>

<h2 id="toc_64">Cleanup</h2>

<p>Gather up all equipment, take down any signs you up, turn off any projectors, and generally put everything back to how you found it. </p>

<h1 id="toc_65">After the Tournament</h1>

<h2 id="toc_66">Fix any statistical errors</h2>

<p>In the event you find any moderator or statistician errors, just re-open the YellowFruit files, make any necessary changes, re-export the files, and re-upload them to the tournament database. </p>

<h2 id="toc_67">Send a wrap-up email to all teams</h2>

<p>Try to send a wrap-up email to teams within a few days of the tournament. You can use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LM6hIj5o-VfuNOtnVE1697lm9JBGwp3aqz4cMKNDqoE/edit?usp=sharing">wrap-up email</a> as a template.</p>

<p>I would recommend creating a new Google Form with <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsG9QooTc1TgVHuI40al4fz4zrkfL9cXxjOaP4_DpKRc7Y-g/viewform">these questions</a>. It’s not a dire necessity, but I think it’s important to make sure that we get any feedback people are willing to offer.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_68">Send all volunteers a thank-you email</h2>

<h3 id="toc_69">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>Include a reminder to delete any copies they have and a reminder that they may not volunteer at any tournaments that use the same set—see the NAQT article “Maintaining Question Security.” </p>

<h2 id="toc_70">Backup your stat sheets and YellowFruit files</h2>

<ol>
<li>Export all Google Sheets as Excel docs, and upload these to a folder in the club Google Drive for posterity.</li>
<li>Upload all YellowFruit files (“Rounds 1-5,” “Finals,” “All Rounds,” etc.) to the Google Drive as well. </li>
<li><strong>For NAQT only:</strong> send the final YellowFruit file, and well as exported copies of every scoresheet, to NAQT at the email address they provide. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_71">Send wrap-up announcement to Quiz Bowl UCF server</h2>

<p>In this announcement...
* Congratulate any winners and high scorers
* Share the link to the statistics page
* Thank first-timers for joining 
* Publicly thank volunteers for their help </p>

<h2 id="toc_72">Pay NAQT/ACF their share of fees, if applicable</h2>

<p>They will initiate this process. Just keep an eye on your email. </p>

<h2 id="toc_73">Write summary follow-up for forum post</h2>

<p>For posterity’s sake, it’s nice to update the initial announcement post on the forums with a quick message. </p>

<p>For example: <em>Congrats to UF A for winning the tournament overall with a 10-0 record (!), to UF D for winning the Undergraduate title, and to John Smith [UF] for winning the overall individual title! Full stats have been posted <here>. Thank you to everyone who attended, especially our volunteer staff!</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">categories: jekyll update</h2>

<h1 id="toc_1">Master Checklist</h1>

<h2 id="toc_2">Decide on a date for the tournament</h2>

<ul>
<li>Check to make sure it’s not the same date as a UCF home game, as you can’t reserve classrooms on those days: https://ucfknights.com/sports/football/schedule.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_3">For ACF:</h3>

<p>They will announce a specific date. </p>

<h3 id="toc_4">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>They will usually restrict tournament dates to a single weekend, so just choose that Saturday, with Sunday as a backup. </p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Submit a bid (ACF or NAQT)</h2>

<h3 id="toc_6">For ACF:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Look on the quiz bowl forums for that tournament’s global announcement—here’s <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26240">ACF Winter 2022</a> </li>
<li>for an example.</li>
<li>Find the link to the “bidding form.”</li>
<li>Provide any information they ask for and submit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_7">For NAQT:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Go to the NAQT site (https://www.naqt.com/), find the appropriate tournament, and fill out the host form. </li>
<li>An NAQT representative will contact you via email shortly. </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_8">As soon as your bid is approved...</h1>

<h2 id="toc_9">Make a room reservation with UCF</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Classroom Reservation form can be accessed at the bottom of <a href="https://registrar.ucf.edu/classroom-reservations/">this page</a>. </li>
<li>Input the following: 

<ul>
<li>Select “Registered Student Organization or SGA/SGA Affiliated Agency”</li>
<li>Faculty Advisor: <Contact information can be found in the Club Wiki> </li>
<li>Event Name: <Name of tournament here> </li>
<li>Event Type: “Collegiate quiz bowl tournament” </li>
<li>Attendees: <the number of people you’re expecting, plus 10> </li>
<li>Event Description: “The Florida site of the (National Academic Quiz Tournaments)/(Academic Competition Federation) <year> <tournament name> tournament—we&#39;ll be hosting teams from other universities as well.”</li>
<li>Room Information: “Ideally, we could reserve ten rooms around the Lupfer Atrium side of Business Administration I.” </li>
<li>Requires multimedia: No</li>
<li>Setup: 7:30am</li>
<li>Start: 8:00am</li>
<li>End: 6:20pm</li>
<li>Cleanup: 6:20pm </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once you send this form, you should automatically receive a confirmation email.</li>
<li>In case you’re wondering, this location, the Lupfer Atrium, is ideal for several reasons: 

<ul>
<li>It has restrooms nearby</li>
<li>First floor and second floor rooms are all close to each other</li>
<li>It’s near the Student Union and parking Garage C</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The registrar’s office can take several business days to reply, so be patient. If you’re emailing them prior to the second week of the semester, don’t expect a reply until Monday of week three at the earliest. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_10">Start recruiting volunteers now, not later</h2>

<p>Your tournament cannot happen without at least one volunteer per room, and ideally two per room.  </p>

<p>Unless you’re willing to spend your own money to compensate volunteers with free lunch, you’ll need to rely on the generosity of the players in your local quiz bowl scene.
* Start with your club. Ask if anyone is ineligible for the competition due to their skill level and start writing down names. 
* Consider asking nearby schools, such as Valencia. You can offer to help them by volunteering for their future tournaments. 
O
nce you’ve recruited at least one volunteer per room, try to recruit two players who would be willing to step down and volunteer the morning of the tournament if need be. Hopefully, they won’t need to staff, but it beats finding out the morning of the competition that you don’t have enough volunteers to run the event.  </p>

<h3 id="toc_11">For NAQT:</h3>

<p>If you’re using NAQT questions, it’s safest to assume that no quiz bowl players or staff from nearby two-year or high schools will be eligible to volunteer. For more information, see <a href="https://www.naqt.com/schedule/assigned-packet-sets.jsp">this page</a>. </p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Post tournament details on the quiz bowl forums</h2>

<p>To make sure everyone knows about your tournament, it is customary to make a formal announcement on the quiz bowl forums. To make an announcement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/">quiz bowl forums</a> and make an account.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the “COLLEGIATE AND OPEN QUIZBOWL DISCUSSION” section.</li>
<li>Click the “Collegiate Announcements &amp; Results” link.</li>
<li>Click “New Topic” in the upper left.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t panic if you make a mistake or forget something—you can edit your post after you’ve submitted it. </p>

<p>Your post will have to be approved by a moderator, so don’t worry if it doesn’t show up immediately. </p>

<h3 id="toc_13">For ACF:</h3>

<ul>
<li>ACF will send you a template post, so all you need to do is just add the information specific to your site. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_14">For NAQT:</h3>

<ul>
<li>There’s no official NAQT announcement template, but you can use <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=392930&amp;">this earlier announcement</a> as a template.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_15">Announce tournament to UCF members</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a tentative signup sheet: 

<ul>
<li>Click “Make a copy” on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cf7gV7h66Y8eXI0iRCXeFQE-tVw-BbM0GlIBy20bGvI/edit?usp=sharing">this Google sheet</a>. </li>
<li>Add a new title.</li>
<li>Set it to be publicly editable. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a new event to the Discord server with the tournament details and the tentative signup link you just made.</li>
<li>@everyone in the Announcements channel with a message including:

<ul>
<li>The name of the tournament </li>
<li>The date and start time</li>
<li>The difficulty of the tournament</li>
<li>The approximate registration cost</li>
<li>Any eligibility requirements</li>
<li>A link to the tentative signup sheet you just made</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
