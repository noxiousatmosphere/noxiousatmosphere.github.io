# One Day Before
{: .no_toc }

## Set up a group chat for all volunteers 
If you have more than ten volunteers, you’ll need to create a separate Discord server and have them join that. 

Either way, send them: 

* A brief welcome message
* The link to the Google Drive score sheets
* The link to the tournament schedule 
* The link to the rules summary (for quick reference) 

Lastly, ping each user to make sure they can actually see your messages.

## Give volunteers access to score sheets

If you followed the steps from earlier, you’ll have already added their emails to the Google Drive folder with the score sheets. 

**Regardless, confirm with each volunteer that they can access their folder!** You will not have time tomorrow morning for troubleshooting Google Drive permissions. 

# Give volunteers access to questions or print off questions 
**Note: Before you give anyone access to the questions, get confirmation in writing that they are volunteering and not competing.**  For the sake of preserving question integrity, someone is ineligible to compete in a tournament the moment they have access to the questions. This even includes situations where someone’s email was added to the question folder but they didn’t actually access the questions yet. For everyone’s sake, double-check this! 
### For NAQT
A representative should have already sent you a ZIP file containing questions. Upload these packets to a new Google Drive folder. Add your volunteers’ email addresses to the Share section of this folder. 
### For ACF
A representative will have already sent you a Google Drive link. Just share this link with the volunteers. If they can’t access the link for some reason, just download the files, place them in a new Google Drive folder, and add their email addresses to that folder. 


# Write a packing list for tomorrow
Before you go to sleep, make sure you know exactly what you need to bring with you the next morning. My packing list usually includes: 

* Energy drink
* Book prizes
* Trophies (if applicable, i.e. ACF) 
* Paper plates and napkins (if you’re supplying lunch to volunteers) 
* Tape + tournament signs 
* USB mouse (for figuring out stats) 
* Library cart (it beats making four trips to your car and back) 
* Extension cords (along with a note of which specific rooms need them)
* Any other extension cords you have
* Laptop + charging cable
* iPhone charger
* 3x UCF buzzer sets


## Check your email inboxes for any stray emails 
Before you lay your head on your pillow the night before the tournament, check your email and your spam folder for any late registrations, last-minute questions, or other concerns. 

## Set several alarms 
As a tournament director, missing an alarm the morning of the tournament is a nightmare-level disaster, so set several alarms! Personally, I...

* Set an alarm on a manual alarm clock across from my bed 
* Set multiple alarms on my iPhone, using an unusual ringtone so I’m unlikely to sleep through them (like a Death Grips song or something) 
* Leave my ringer up overnight and ask my father to call me if he doesn't hear from me by 6:00am

Whatever steps you take, make sure that there’s no possible way you miss your alarms.
