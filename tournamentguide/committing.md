#  Deciding to Host a Tournament

## Decide on a date for the tournament
Check to make sure it’s not the same date as a UCF home game, as you can’t reserve classrooms on those days: https://ucfknights.com/sports/football/schedule.  


### For ACF: 
They will announce a specific date. 



### For NAQT:
They will usually restrict tournament dates to a single weekend, so just choose that Saturday, with Sunday as a backup. 

## Submit a bid (ACF or NAQT)
### For ACF:
 
* Look on the quiz bowl forums for that tournament’s global announcement—here’s [ACF Winter 2022](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26240) 
* for an example.
* Find the link to the “bidding form.”
* Provide any information they ask for and submit.

### For NAQT: 
* Go to the NAQT site (https://www.naqt.com/), find the appropriate tournament, and fill out the host form. 
* An NAQT representative will contact you via email shortly.
