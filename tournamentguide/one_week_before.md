## Decide what awards to announce
This is ultimately up to your discretion as tournament director. depends on the size of your tournament. 

I would recommend announcing the top five individual scorers overall. 

### For NAQT
The NAQT representative you've been in contact with will let you know what awards you are required to announce. These awards are usually: 

* Division I Champion
* Division I Undergraduate Champion (i.e. all team members are undergraduates)
* Division II Champion (i.e. all team members have not played an NAQT tournament before)

## Prepare notes for the opening meeting
It is essential to establish expectations at the beginning of every tournament, regardless of how well everyone in the Florida quiz bowl circuit knows each other. This is especially true if there are any first-time competitors present.

I would strongly recommend including the following: 

* A brief welcome to the teams
* An informal school roll call—confirm that each team has all members accounted for 
* Awards that will be given out (top ten individual players, etc.) 
* Lunch information (after what round) 
* Restroom locations 
* General expectations and rules: 
	* Time limits for answering tossups/bonuses
	* Devices need to be silenced and put away 
	* Please watch your volume if you’re waiting for a round to finish
	* We’re breaking for lunch after round X 
* Asking if anyone has any questions

## Send logistics/rules info to all teams 
I would recommend using email. You can this as a template: [Logistics Email Template for Teams](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvpymlu8sga7Q6EIlyWUQ5HV9jMO6FphdgXqYYciDLQ/edit?usp=sharing). 

Be sure to include the map of BA1 in this document as an attachment to the email. 

Send this email using the same address that you listed for the tournament entry and for the forum post! Otherwise it might go to people’s spam folders. 

## Send logistics/rules info to all volunteers 
Again, I would recommend sending all this information via email. 

You can use this as a template: [Logistics Email Template for Volunteers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9U5jKk7Ca8ORGsVMTgnvdvjHCDlphXpn7_yuP0ABXg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Reach out to teams for a last call for signups 
In a small quiz bowl circuit like ours, schools will allow teams to register up until the last minute—say, Thursday night for a Saturday tournament. However, it’s best to find out the final team count as soon as possible, since you need to ensure you have enough rooms and volunteers. 

Either message the FL quiz bowl group chat or reach out via email to each school confirm how many teams each school is sending. 

## Send invoices to all registered teams
Use this [invoice template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LAe9VNWhElItCBOFuhfGaHLt-TxHW9Zb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100109936307561193680&rtpof=true&sd=true) and create a separate invoice for each school that’s attending. 

Email it to the representative of each school. You can include this [invoice message text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NX8nZsaWjCiqzjThS6bjM5EeJaKRCV__82wzslSuD7I/edit) in your email. 

### For ACF
The ACF site director will give you access to a spreadsheet with each team’s registration details. 
### For NAQT
On the NAQT site page for your tournament site, click on “Current Field” to see each team’s registration details.  

## Create the tournament schedule
Once your roster of teams is more or less finalized, I would strongly recommend using the HDWhite [Quizbowl Schedule Generator](https://hdwhite.org/qb/schedules/). 

This tool will automatically generate a schedule for you—all you need to do is...
1. Select the total number of teams 
2. Choose a tournament format (select "round robin" unless someone tells you otherwise)
3. Add the abbreviated team names, one per line 
4. Add the room numbers, one per line (I would strongly recommend including the moderator last name as well—ex. "122 Smith") 
5. Select the number of finals matches you want (unless **NAQT** tells you otherwise, select "one") 

You can always edit the schedule later, so don't worry if you're still confirming room/team/volunteer details. 

Note that this site produces two links: 

* An editable link—do not share this with anyone else!
* A public link—this can be shared with volunteers and players

## Set up your digital scoresheets 
In my experience, digital score sheets are the most straightforward, reliable solution. They can’t be lost, misplaced, or ruined by a spilled drink, and most importantly, they can be seen remotely—you don’t have to be in a room to see how far along the round has progressed. 

I would **strongly** recommend using the scoresheet template from NAQT, regardless of whether or not you’re hosting a NAQT tournament. These score sheets calculate bonus and running totals automatically, so all the scorekeeper needs to do is add team names, player names, and a mark each time a question is answered. 

### Full instructions: 

1. Open this blank [NAQT Scoresheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wrjU6Fg-PKuR2B1MLvp_gAOluJyQvFy_EVPZMsd4Mq4/edit#gid=1305109048).
2. Click on the File tab, then “Make a Copy”
3. Select the folder you want to save this copy to. I’d suggest making a new folder with the tournament name, if you haven’t already. 
4. Click “Make a Copy.” 
5. Next, navigate to this new folder. Create a new sub-folder for each gameplay room. For example, if your tournament has five rounds of gameplay going on simultaneously, create five new folders. 
6. Rename each folder with the room number and the last name of the reader who will be staffing it. This will save you a lot of headache later! See below:

7. Open the score sheet. 
8. Fill out the red-highlighted cell next to the word “Event.” (For example, “NAQT SCT 2023 @UCF”) 
9. Right-click the tab titled “Scoresheet” at the bottom, and click “Duplicate.” 
10. Do this for as many rounds of gameplay as you have on the schedule, plus two more in case of tiebreakers or final matches. For example, if you’re playing a nine-game round robin, you should have a total of eleven tabs in this score sheet. 
11. Rename each tab “Round 1,” “Round 2,” etc. with the last two called “Final Round #1” and “Final Round #2” 
12. On each tab, fill in the red-highlighted cell next to the word “Round.” Make sure that this number is the same as the title of the tab! 
13. You can leave the “Instructions” tab there for the score keeper’s reference. 
14. Now go back to the Google Drive folder, right click this file, and click “Make a Copy.” Do this until you have one copy in each room folder. 
15. Click on the person icon in the Google Drive menu and add the volunteer’s emails. It will automatically notify them via email that they’ve been granted access. 


## Update your reference page for the day of the tournament
You should be able to open this document on your laptop and reference it at any time. It should include every link or piece of information you could possibly need. 

Here’s a non-exhaustive list:  

* The room reservation number
* The phone number to call in case doors are locked
* Links to the forum post
* Link to the official tournament entry 
* Link to the official team rosters
* Contact info for all teams
* Contact info for all volunteers
* An organized list of which teams are D1 and which are D2, if applicable  
* Editable link to tournament schedule
* Shareable link to tournament schedule 

## Train your stats keeper
In addition to the score keeping that happens during each round, someone has to take all this data and compile it in [YellowFruit](https://y.yellowfruit.app). This program takes round data and exports HTML score reports that can be uploaded to the tournament database. 

In all likelihood, you as Tournament Director will be the scorekeeper. Be sure to bring a mouse, charger, or anything you need to work quickly. 

Make sure you [install YellowFruit](https://github.com/ANadig/YellowFruit/releases/tag/v3.0.2) before the tournament and check that the program can run on your device without crashing or stalling. 

**Note:** YellowFruit is not available for Macs at this time. If you don’t own a PC, you will need to borrow a PC from a club member to use the day of the tournament. Don’t try to borrow a laptop from the library—you can’t download and run new programs on those. 

## Read the rest of this guide!
While you have time, [read ahead in this guide](https://noxiousatmosphere.github.io/tournamentguide/one_day_before.html) and make sure you understand what you need to do during the tournament. **If you fail to plan for something and don’t realize until the day of the tournament, you will not have time to recover!**
