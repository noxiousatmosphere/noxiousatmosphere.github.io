#Introduction 

College quiz bowl can't happen without people stepping up to volunteer as Tournament Directors (TDs), so I've compiled everything I've learned the hard way as a neophyte TD into this guide. It is intended to provide a (nearly) comprehensive, top-down overview of what steps need to be taken when planning and hosting a tournament. 

If you notice any errors or glaring omissions in this guide, I welcome any feedback: fantradisc#3677 (Discord). 

If you have any questions or concerns about hosting, reach out to me, former TDs your know, or [the quiz bowl forums](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/). The community is more than happy to help new tournament directors. 

Don't be afraid to ask questions, and be sure to do so ahead of time—if you wait too long, your tournament may suffer for it!

That being said, don't be afraid to step up and direct—if you have the time and are willing to put in the effort, it's a great way to contribute to your region's quiz bowl scene (and also make some cash for your club while you're at it).
