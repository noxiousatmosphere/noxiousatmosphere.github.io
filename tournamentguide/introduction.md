## What is this? 
This guide is a compilation everything I've learned the hard way as a neophyte tournament director. It's intended to provide a (nearly) comprehensive, top-down overview of every step that goes into successfull hosting a quiz bowl tournament. Other tournament hosting guides exist, but I wanted to write one specific to UCF and include some tips I haven't read elsewhere.  

## Why host tournaments? 

If you have the time and are willing to put in the effort, hosting tournaments is a great way to contribute to your region's quiz bowl scene (plus, it's also a great way to raise funds for your club). Quiz bowl can't happen without tournament directors (TDs) and volunteers, so I'd encourage you to consider helping host a tournament if you haven't already. 

## Notice a mistake?

If you notice any errors or glaring omissions in this guide, I welcome any feedback (<hkeating1@outlook.com>). 

## Have any questions? 

If you have any questions or concerns about hosting, reach out to me (<hkeating1@outlook.com>), former TDs your know, or [the quiz bowl forums](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/). The community is more than happy to help new tournament directors. 

Don't be afraid to ask questions, and be sure to do so ahead of timeâ€”if you wait too long, your tournament may suffer for it!
