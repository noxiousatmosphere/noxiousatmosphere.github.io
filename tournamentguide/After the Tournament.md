## Fix any statistical errors
In the event you find any moderator or statistician errors, just re-open the YellowFruit files, make any necessary changes, re-export the files, and re-upload them to the tournament database. 


## Send a wrap-up email to all teams
Try to send a wrap-up email to teams within a few days of the tournament. You can use this [wrap-up email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LM6hIj5o-VfuNOtnVE1697lm9JBGwp3aqz4cMKNDqoE/edit?usp=sharing) as a template.

I would recommend creating a new Google Form with [these questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsG9QooTc1TgVHuI40al4fz4zrkfL9cXxjOaP4_DpKRc7Y-g/viewform). It’s not a dire necessity, but I think it’s important to make sure that we get any feedback people are willing to offer.  

## Send all volunteers a thank-you email
### For NAQT:
Include a reminder to delete any copies they have and a reminder that they may not volunteer at any tournaments that use the same set—see the NAQT article “Maintaining Question Security.” 

## Backup your stat sheets and YellowFruit files
1. Export all Google Sheets as Excel docs, and upload these to a folder in the club Google Drive for posterity.
1. Upload all YellowFruit files (“Rounds 1-5,” “Finals,” “All Rounds,” etc.) to the Google Drive as well. 
1. **For NAQT only:** send the final YellowFruit file, and well as exported copies of every scoresheet, to NAQT at the email address they provide. 

## Send wrap-up announcement to Quiz Bowl UCF server
In this announcement...
* Congratulate any winners and high scorers
* Share the link to the statistics page
* Thank first-timers for joining 
* Publicly thank volunteers for their help 

## Pay NAQT/ACF their share of fees, if applicable 
They will initiate this process. Just keep an eye on your email. 

## Write summary follow-up for forum post
For posterity’s sake, it’s nice to update the initial announcement post on the forums with a quick message. 

For example: *Congrats to UF A for winning the tournament overall with a 10-0 record (!), to UF D for winning the Undergraduate title, and to John Smith [UF] for winning the overall individual title! Full stats have been posted <here>. Thank you to everyone who attended, especially our volunteer staff!*
