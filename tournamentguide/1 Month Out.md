# 1 Month Out
## Start a running roster of all teams 
### For ACF:
The tournament coordinator will have reached out to you by now with more information, which will include a running sheet of teams who have signed up.

Just keep an eye on this sheet for now, and text nearby schools to get an idea of how many teams they’ll be sending.

In the meantime, start a Google Sheet with the names of each team and the names of each player. This will come in handy later. 

### For NAQT: 
On the NAQT site page for your tournament site, click on “Current Field” to see what teams have signed up. 

Just keep an eye on this page for now, and text nearby schools to get an idea of how many teams they’ll be sending. 

In the meantime, start a Google Sheet with the names of each team and the names of each player. This will come in handy later.
