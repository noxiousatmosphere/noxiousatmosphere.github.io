# Tournament Day

## Arrive two hours early
You need to be done setting up by the time volunteers are arriving, so it’s better to have time to kill than to be running late. 

Additionally, this gives you time to recover if any doors are locked and you need to get a janitor over there. 

## Check all doors and rooms are opened
Some classrooms in BA1 have two doors, so make sure that each door is unlocked. 

## Set up power cords and buzzers
Because you inspected the rooms a week ago, you’ll already have an idea of what rooms need extra power cords or other equipment. 
Make a note of which rooms are not using UCF buzzers—this makes packing up easier when teams are trying to leave. 

## Put navigation and volume warning signs up around BA1
While it’s technically not allowed, I prefer to place volume warning signs around BA1. I'd rather have to take down a sign than get noise complaints from players.

## Set up opening meeting 
* Turn on all the lights
* Turn on the projector
* Pull up the publicly viewable tournament schedule
* Play some light music to set the mood 

## Welcome teams as they arrive
Self-explanatory.

## Host opening meeting
Just follow the notes you prepared earlier. 

## Compile statistics for each round
As each round ends, immediately input the round data into YellowFruit. 

When the last round before lunch is complete, upload your stats so far to the tournament database so players can view them during their lunch break. 

**Very important note:** You won't be able to announce winners or set up final matches until you've compiled the scores from every preliminary round. Hence, it is crucial that you've compiled every previous round **before** the preliminary round finishes. This will minimize the delay before final matches and the awards ceremony. 
* For example: if your tournament is a nine-game round robin, you need to have compiled every match from rounds 1-8  before round #9 finishes. This way, you only need to add the four or five games from round #9 for your stats to be done. 

No one can play until these statistics are compiled, so make sure this does not catch you by surprise! 

## Break for lunch 
I would strongly recommend allotting 45 minutes for lunch. If people take longer than this, you still have 15 minutes of wiggle room. Any longer than an hour, and you’re just burning daylight! 

## Rebracket or set up finals rounds as necessary 
You could write an entire manual just on this step, but for final rounds, just follow the instructions at the bottom of the HDWhite schedule. If you're hosting an NAQT tournament, they will tell you how to run final rounds. 

## Prepare notes for the awards ceremony
* As the last round is coming to a close, you should have a solid idea of which teams are going to come out on top. 
* Prepare a list of the top highest-scoring individuals, based on individual points per game (PPG) from **preliminary** (not finals) rounds. 

## Awards ceremony 
Quiz bowl crowds hate pomp and circumstance, so keep the announcements quick and straightforward.

Announce the winners from first place downwards, so they can get first picks of the book prizes. 

## Cleanup 
Gather up all equipment, take down any signs you up, turn off any projectors, and generally put everything back to how you found it.
