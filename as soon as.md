## Make a room reservation with UCF 
* The Classroom Reservation form can be accessed at the bottom of [this page](https://registrar.ucf.edu/classroom-reservations/). 
* Input the following: 
	* Select “Registered Student Organization or SGA/SGA Affiliated Agency”
	* Faculty Advisor: <Contact information can be found in the Club Wiki> 
	* Event Name: <Name of tournament here> 
	* Event Type: “Collegiate quiz bowl tournament” 
	* Attendees: <the number of people you’re expecting, plus 10> 
	* Event Description: “The Florida site of the (National Academic Quiz Tournaments)/(Academic Competition Federation) <year> <tournament name> tournament—we'll be hosting teams from other universities as well.”
	* Room Information: “Ideally, we could reserve ten rooms around the Lupfer Atrium side of Business Administration I.” 
	* Requires multimedia: No
	* Setup: 7:30am
	* Start: 8:00am
	* End: 6:20pm
	* Cleanup: 6:20pm 
* Once you send this form, you should automatically receive a confirmation email.
* In case you’re wondering, this location, the Lupfer Atrium, is ideal for several reasons: 
	* It has restrooms nearby
	* First floor and second floor rooms are all close to each other
	* It’s near the Student Union and parking Garage C
* The registrar’s office can take several business days to reply, so be patient. If you’re emailing them prior to the second week of the semester, don’t expect a reply until Monday of week three at the earliest. 

## Start recruiting volunteers now, not later
Your tournament cannot happen without at least one volunteer per room, and ideally two per room.  

Unless you’re willing to spend your own money to compensate volunteers with free lunch, you’ll need to rely on the generosity of the players in your local quiz bowl scene.
* Start with your club. Ask if anyone is ineligible for the competition due to their skill level and start writing down names. 
* Consider asking nearby schools, such as Valencia. You can offer to help them by volunteering for their future tournaments. 
O
nce you’ve recruited at least one volunteer per room, try to recruit two players who would be willing to step down and volunteer the morning of the tournament if need be. Hopefully, they won’t need to staff, but it beats finding out the morning of the competition that you don’t have enough volunteers to run the event.  

### For NAQT:
If you’re using NAQT questions, it’s safest to assume that no quiz bowl players or staff from nearby two-year or high schools will be eligible to volunteer. For more information, see [this page](https://www.naqt.com/schedule/assigned-packet-sets.jsp). 

## Post tournament details on the quiz bowl forums
To make sure everyone knows about your tournament, it is customary to make a formal announcement on the quiz bowl forums. To make an announcement:

* Navigate to the [quiz bowl forums](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/) and make an account.
* Scroll down to the “COLLEGIATE AND OPEN QUIZBOWL DISCUSSION” section.
* Click the “Collegiate Announcements & Results” link.
* Click “New Topic” in the upper left.

Don’t panic if you make a mistake or forget something—you can edit your post after you’ve submitted it. 

Your post will have to be approved by a moderator, so don’t worry if it doesn’t show up immediately. 

### For ACF: 
* ACF will send you a template post, so all you need to do is just add the information specific to your site. 

### For NAQT: 
* There’s no official NAQT announcement template, but you can use [this earlier announcement](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=392930&) as a template.


## Announce tournament to UCF members 
1. Create a tentative signup sheet: 
	* Click “Make a copy” on [this Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cf7gV7h66Y8eXI0iRCXeFQE-tVw-BbM0GlIBy20bGvI/edit?usp=sharing). 
	* Add a new title.
	* Set it to be publicly editable. 
1. Add a new event to the Discord server with the tournament details and the tentative signup link you just made.
1. @everyone in the Announcements channel with a message including:
	* The name of the tournament 
	* The date and start time
	* The difficulty of the tournament
	* The approximate registration cost
	* Any eligibility requirements
	* A link to the tentative signup sheet you just made


## Create a reference page for the day of the tournament
When you’re planning and running a tournament, things move quickly, and there’s a lot of information you need to keep at your fingertips. I would recommend keeping a document for every piece of information that you may need the day of the tournament. 

I would recommend Notes (Mac), Notion, Google Docs, or whatever platform you can access quickly and reliably. 

For now, I would recommend including: 
* The room reservation number
* The phone number to call in case doors are locked
* Links to the forum post
* Link to the official tournament entry 
* Link to the official team rosters
* Any other relevant links or information as you find them
