# Tournament Hosting Guide

College quiz bowl can't happen without people stepping up to volunteer as Tournament Directors (TDs). This guide provides a comprehensie, top-down overview of what steps need to be taken when planning and hosting a tournament. 

If you have any questions or concerns about hosting, reach out to people you know with directing experience, or ask on the quiz bowl forums. People in the quiz bowl community are more than happy to share their knowledge. Reach out ahead of time—if you wait too long, your tournament may suffer for it.

That being said, don't be afraid of TD'ing—if you have the time and are willing to put in the effort, it's a great way to contribute to your region's quiz bowl scene (and also make some cash for your club while you're at it).

If you notice any errors or glaring omissions in this guide, I welcome any feedback: fantradisc#3677 (Discord).
