# Tournament Hosting Guide

College quiz bowl can't happen without people stepping up to volunteer as Tournament Directors (TDs). While this guide is not perfectly comprehensive, it provides a top-down overview of what steps need to be taken when planning and hosting a tournament. 

If this guide doesn't cover something, reach out to people you know with TD experience or ask on the quiz bowl forums. People are happy to share their knowledge. Don't be afraid to reach out for help—the last thing the community needs is a poorly run tournament.  

That being said, don't be afraid of TD'ing—if you have the time and are willing to put in the effort, it's a great way to contribute to your region's quiz bowl scene (and also make some cash for your club while you're at it).

If you notice any mistakes or glaring omissions in this guide, I welcome any feedback: fantradisc#3677 (Discord).
